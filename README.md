#what is linkedlist?

``` In C++, a linked list is a dynamic data structure that is commonly used to implement other data structures such as stacks, queues, and associative arrays. A linked list consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list.

Here is an example of how to implement a linked list in C++: ```

````C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class LinkedList {
private:
    Node* head;

public:
    LinkedList() {
        head = NULL;
    }

    void insert(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->next = head;
        head = newNode;
    }

    void display() {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp != NULL) {
            cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList myList;
    myList.insert(5);
    myList.insert(10);
    myList.insert(15);
    myList.display();
    return 0;
}

````


```
This example creates a Node class to represent each node in the list, and a LinkedList class to manage the list. The insert function inserts a new node at the beginning of the list, and the display function prints out the contents of the list.

In this example, the linked list contains three nodes with the values 15, 10, and 5, in that order. The display function prints out these values in reverse order.
```
